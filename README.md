# SSL Certificate Request (CSR) Generator Tool
SSL certificate CSR generator with SAN support because I waste a half hour every time I need to generate one trying to figure out the syntax again

## Ideas

Thinking out loud so one day I can finish this little tool and remember what I originally wanted to accomplish...

- Live update of snippet text
- Subject Alternative Name (SAN) support
- Full descriptions of all the components that were originally confusing to me when I was learning about PKI:
    - Key Usage options
    - Extended Key Usage options
    - Constraints
    - Other things from the RFC that I can't remember
